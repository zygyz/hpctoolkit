Given an application binary, a shared library, or an hpctoolkit
measurement directory collected for a GPU-accelerated program that run
on NVIDIA GPUs, hpcstruct recovers the program structure of its object
code.  Program structure is a mapping of a program's static source-level
structure to its object code.  By default, hpcstruct writes its results
to the file 'basename(<binary>).hpcstruct'.  This file is typically
passed to HPCToolkit's correlation tool hpcprof.

hpcstruct is designed for highly optimized binaries created from
compiled languages such as C, C++, Fortran, and CUDA source code. Because
hpcstruct's algorithms exploit a binary's debugging information, for best
results, binary should be compiled with standard debugging information.
See the documentation for more information.

Options: General
  -v [<n>], --verbose [<n>]
                       Verbose: generate progress messages to stderr at
                       verbosity level <n>. {1}
  -V, --version        Print version information.
  -h, --help           Print this help.
  --debug=[<n>]        Debug: use debug level <n>. {1}
  --debug-proc <glob>  Debug structure recovery for procedures matching
                       the procedure glob <glob>
  -j <num>, --jobs <num>  Use <num> openmp threads (jobs), default 1.
  --jobs-parse <num>   Use <num> openmp threads for ParseAPI::parse(),
                       default is same value for --jobs.
  --jobs-symtab <num>  Use <num> openmp threads for Symtab methods.
  --time               Display stats on time and space usage.

Options: Structure recovery
  -I <path>, --include <path>
                       Use <path> when resolving source file names. For a
                       recursive search, append a '*' after the last slash,
                       e.g., '/mypath/*' (quote or escape to protect from
                       the shell.) May pass multiple times.

  -R '<old-path>=<new-path>', --replace-path '<old-path>=<new-path>'
                       Substitute instances of <old-path> with <new-path>;
                       apply to all paths (profile's load map, source code)
                       for which <old-path> is a prefix.  Use '\\' to escape
                       instances of '=' within a path. May pass multiple
                       times.
  --use-binutils       Use binutils as the default binary instruction decoder
                       On x86 default is Intel XED library.
  --show-gaps          Experimental feature to show unclaimed vma ranges (gaps)
                       in the control-flow graph.

Options: Demangling
  --demangle-library <path to demangling library>
                       Specify the pathname for a dynamically-linked
                       library whose demangler function should 
                       be used for demangling. By default, the demangler used
                       is __cxa_demangle in the C++ Standard Library linked into
                       hpcstruct.

  --demangle-function <name of the demangler>
                       By default, the demangler used is __cxa_demangle, a function
                       provided by the C++ Standard Library. This option enables
                       one to specify an alternate demangler, e.g., cplus_demangle
                       provided by the BFD library.

Options: Output:
  -o <file>, --output <file>
                       Write hpcstruct file to <file>.
                       Use '--output=-' to write output to stdout.
  --compact            Generate compact output, eliminating extra white space
